Problem Description

Given a matrix of integers A of size N x M describing a maze. The maze consists of empty locations and walls.

1 represents a wall in a matrix and 0 represents an empty location in a wall.

There is a ball trapped in a maze. The ball can go through empty spaces by rolling up, down, left or right, but it won't stop rolling until hitting a wall (maze boundary is also considered as a wall). When the ball stops, it could choose the next direction.

Given two array of integers of size B and C of size 2 denoting the starting and destination position of the ball.

Find the shortest distance for the ball to stop at the destination. The distance is defined by the number of empty spaces traveled by the ball from the starting position (excluded) to the destination (included). If the ball cannot stop at the destination, return -1.



Problem Constraints

2 <= N, M <= 100

0 <= A[i] <= 1

0 <= B[i][0], C[i][0] < N

0 <= B[i][1], C[i][1] < M



Input Format

The first argument given is the integer matrix A.

The second argument given is an array of integer B.

The third argument if an array of integer C.



Output Format

Return a single integer, the minimum distance required to reach destination



Example Input

Input 1:


A = [ [0, 0], 
      [0, 0] ]
B = [0, 0]
C = [0, 1]


Input 2:

A = [ [0, 1], 
      [1, 0] ]
B = [0, 0]
C = [1, 1]












Example Output

Output 1:


 1


Output 2:

 -1












Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

 Go directly from start to destination in distance 1.
Explanation 2:

 It is impossible to reach the destination from (0, 0) to (1, 1) as there are walls at (1, 0) and (0, 1)

Solution

import heapq
class Solution:
    # @param A : list of list of integers
    # @param B : list of integers
    # @param C : list of integers
    # @return an integer
    def solve(self, A, B, C):
        array =  []
        heapq.heappush(array,(0,B[0],B[1]))
        path = [[float("inf")] * len(A[0]) for i in range(len(A))]
        visit = set()
        path[B[0]][B[1]] = 0 
        directions = [(0,1),(1,0),(0,-1),(-1,0)]

        while array:
            distance,row,col = heapq.heappop(array)
            if (row,col) not in visit:
                visit.add((row,col))
                for i,j in directions:
                    newi = row 
                    newj = col 
                    length = 0 
                    while 0 <= newi + i < len(A) and 0 <= newj + j < len(A[0]) and A[newi + i][newj + j] == 0:
                         newi += i 
                         newj += j 
                         length += 1 
                    if path[newi][newj] > distance + length:

                             path[newi][newj] = distance + length
                             heapq.heappush(array,(distance + length,newi,newj))

        return -1 if path[C[0]][C[1]] == float("inf") else path[C[0]][C[1]]
