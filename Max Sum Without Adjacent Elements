Problem Description
Given a 2 x N grid of integers, A, your task is to choose numbers from the grid such that sum of these numbers is maximized. 
However, you cannot choose two numbers that are adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. 

Return the maximum possible sum.

Note: You are allowed to choose more than 2 numbers from the grid.


Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 20000
1 <= A[i] <= 2000


Input Format
The first and the only argument of input contains a 2d matrix, A.


Output Format
Return an integer, representing the maximum possible sum.


Example Input
Input 1:

 A = [   
        [1]
        [2]    
     ]
Input 2:

 A = [   
        [1, 2, 3, 4]
        [2, 3, 4, 5]    
     ]


Example Output
Output 1:

 2
Output 2:

 8


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 We will choose 2 (From 2nd row 1st column).
Explanation 2:

 We will choose 3 (From 2nd row 2nd column) and 5 (From 2nd row 4th column).

SOLUTION

class Solution:
	# @param A : list of list of integers
	# @return an integer
	def adjacent(self, A):
        arr = []
        i = 0
        while i < len(A[0]):
            arr.append(max(A[0][i],A[1][i]))
            i += 1
        dp = []
        for i in range(len(arr)):
            taken = arr[i]
            nottaken = 0 
            if i > 1:
                taken += dp[i-2]
            if i >= 1:
                nottaken += dp[i-1] 
            dp.append(max(taken,nottaken))
        return dp[len(arr) - 1]
