We have a list of asteroids representing asteroids in a row. Each asteroid is represented by its size, and
an integer array asteroids represents the sizes of the asteroids in the order they appear. The asteroids
with negative sizes move to the left, and the asteroids with positive sizes move to the right. When two
asteroids collide, the smaller asteroid will explode. If they are the same size, both asteroids will be
destroyed. Two asteroids moving in the same direction will never collide.

Input: [5, 10, -5]
Output: [5, 10]
Explanation:
The asteroid 10 and -5 collide resulting in the -5 asteroid being destroyed.

Input: [10,2,-5]
Output: [10]
Explanation:
The 2 and -5 collide resulting in -5. The 10 and -5 collide resulting in 10.

Input: [2,3,4,-6,7,-9,10]
output: [-6, -9, 10]

[-5, 6, -8]
